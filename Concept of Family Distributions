# ðŸ“Š Family of Distributions in Input Data Modeling

This demo introduces a set of probability distributions commonly used to model **uncertain input data** in simulations, analytics, and operations research. For each distribution, we provide:

- A short explanation of when it's used
- A one-sample real-world problem
- A summary of the solution and interpretation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

In input data modeling, a **family of probability distributions** helps represent uncertain variables like demand, service times, or failure intervals. Choosing the right distribution depends on:

- Whether data is continuous or discrete
- If it is symmetric or skewed
- If it is bounded or unbounded

This demo helps learners and analysts understand which distribution to use and why.

## ðŸ“š Distributions with Problems and Solutions

---

### 1. **Exponential Distribution**
**Used for:** Time between events in a continuous process.

**Problem:** A machine breaks down once every 8 hours on average. What is the probability that it runs more than 10 hours without failure?

**Solution:** Use exponential distribution to model the time between failures. The longer the time exceeds the mean, the lower the probability.

---

### 2. **Normal Distribution**
**Used for:** Symmetric data like test scores, weights, etc.

**Problem:** The average height of students is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. What proportion are taller than 180 cm?

**Solution:** Convert the value to a Z-score and use standard normal tables to find the probability.

---

### 3. **Poisson Distribution**
**Used for:** Counting the number of discrete events in a fixed time/area.

**Problem:** A helpdesk receives an average of 3 calls per hour. What is the probability that exactly 5 calls come in the next hour?

**Solution:** Use the Poisson distribution to compute the probability of exactly 5 events when the average is known.

---

### 4. **Binomial Distribution**
**Used for:** Trials with binary outcomes (success/failure).

**Problem:** A server has a 90% chance of uptime per day. What is the probability itâ€™s online for 9 out of 10 days?

**Solution:** Use binomial distribution with 10 trials and 0.9 success probability.

---

### 5. **Triangular Distribution**
**Used for:** Estimating outcomes with only min, most likely, and max values.

**Problem:** A delivery time estimate is 2 days (min), 4 days (most likely), and 7 days (max). What is the probability of receiving the item within 5 days?

**Solution:** Use triangular distribution to approximate based on subjective expert estimates.

---

### 6. **Lognormal Distribution**
**Used for:** Skewed data where values are always positive.

**Problem:** The time to complete a task is positively skewed with occasional long delays. How do we model the task duration?

**Solution:** Use lognormal distribution, as it models skewed right-tailed data like time, money, or growth rates.

---

### 7. **Gamma Distribution**
**Used for:** Modeling waiting time until multiple events occur.

**Problem:** You need to wait for 3 service calls to finish. Each service has random time, but the total follows a certain shape. What is the chance the total takes less than 15 minutes?

**Solution:** Use gamma distribution with shape parameter = 3.

---

### 8. **Beta Distribution**
**Used for:** Modeling proportions or probabilities between 0 and 1.

**Problem:** A project manager estimates the completion probability to be between 60% and 90%. What distribution fits this and lets us simulate the uncertainty?

**Solution:** Use beta distribution, ideal for modeling limited-range variables like percentages or confidence scores.

---

### 9. **Weibull Distribution**
**Used for:** Modeling product lifespan or reliability.

**Problem:** An engineer needs to model the probability that a part will fail within 1 year.

**Solution:** Use the Weibull distribution, especially useful in reliability testing where failure rates change over time.

---

### 10. **Uniform Distribution**
**Used for:** Modeling equally likely outcomes in a given range.

**Problem:** A part will arrive between 3 and 6 days randomly. What is the chance it comes before 5 days?

**Solution:** Use uniform distribution to calculate evenly distributed probabilities between bounds.
